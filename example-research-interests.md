# Research Interests Document Template

> **Instructions:** This is a template file. Copy it to your own file (e.g., `my-research-interests.md`)
> and replace the bracketed sections with your actual research interests, methods, and goals.
> This content is read at runtime and injected into the AI agent's prompts to guide how
> professors are evaluated for fit with YOUR research interests.

## Research Interests

[Describe your primary research area and the specific topics you want to explore during your PhD. Be specific about the problems you want to solve, the domains you're interested in, and what excites you about this area.]

**Example topics to cover:**
- What broad research area are you interested in? (e.g., machine learning, human-computer interaction, systems, theory)
- What specific sub-areas or problems within that field?
- Are there particular application domains you want to focus on?
- What questions or challenges motivate your research?

## Methods and Approaches

[List the technical methods, algorithms, frameworks, or research methodologies you want to work with or learn during your PhD. The agent will look for professors who use these approaches.]

**Example methods to list:**
- Specific algorithms or techniques (e.g., reinforcement learning, causal inference, natural language processing)
- Research methodologies (e.g., user studies, theoretical analysis, large-scale experiments)
- Tools or frameworks (e.g., simulation platforms, specific ML architectures)
- Evaluation approaches you're interested in

## Background and Experience

[Briefly describe your relevant background, previous research experience, or projects that have prepared you for PhD work. This helps the agent understand what skills you bring and what direction you're headed.]

**Optional sections:**
- Previous research projects or publications
- Relevant work experience
- Technical skills and tools you're proficient with
- Specific courses or training that shaped your interests

## Key Papers or Inspirations

[Optional: List 3-5 papers, researchers, or projects that inspire your research direction. The agent can use these as reference points when evaluating professor fit.]

**Format:**
- Author(s). Year. "Paper Title." Venue.
  - Brief note on why this work interests you or how it relates to your goals

## What You're Looking For in an Advisor

[Optional: Describe what you value in a PhD advisor and lab environment. This can help refine the evaluation criteria.]

**Examples:**
- Collaborative vs independent research style
- Preference for theoretical vs applied work
- Interest in interdisciplinary collaboration
- Importance of funding, lab size, or publication cadence

## How This File Is Used

The research agent:
1. Reads this entire file at the start of each professor evaluation
2. Extracts your research themes, target methods, and preferences
3. Uses this information to score professors across 7 categories:
   - Research Alignment: How well does their work match your interests?
   - Methods Overlap: Do they use the techniques you want to learn?
   - Trajectory & Venues: Are they publishing recently in quality venues?
   - Advising Capacity: Are they taking students?
   - Lab Environment: What's the lab culture and student outcomes?
   - Funding: Do they have active grants?
   - Program Fit: Is their department/program the right fit?
4. Generates a scored report

**The more specific you are in this file, the better the agent can evaluate fit.**
